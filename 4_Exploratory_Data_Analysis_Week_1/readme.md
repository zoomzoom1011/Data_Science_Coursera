To test all the results, we need to check: 

Was a valid GitHub URL containing a git repository submitted?

Does the GitHub repository contain at least one commit beyond the original fork?

Please examine the plot files in the GitHub repository. Do the plot files appear to be of the correct graphics file format?

Does each plot appear correct?

Does each set of R code appear to create the reference plot?
